# Only TRUE Intellectuals Will Understand
I have made a courageous decision today. I have decided to move all of the memes from kylediaz.com to a new website, meme.kylediaz.com
You may have noticed that kylediaz.com isnt updated that often. The rate at which I update kylediaz.com isn't enough to satisfy your never-ending lust for delectable memes, which you slowly tear apart like meat from a bone and let the amino acids of the memes disolve on the tip of your tongue. I have failed you, and I aim to correct that.
If you want your quick rush from memes, go to meme.kylediaz.com. It's hosted by github, so if you go to github.com/kylediaz/kylediaz.github.io you can even put your own memes on my website (>:( nothing bad please or I will break out the jumper cables), otherwise you can go the real kylediaz.com and partake in some intellectually stimulating memes. While richer in flavour, those doses won't come as often.

Thank you
Kyle Diaz
