        <h1>I'm sorry</h1>
        
        <p>Unbeknownst to you, kylediaz.com had a goal it was trying to achieve this entire time: to get support for PHP and SQL. Sadly, this will never be within our grasp. As it turns out, it is literally against the law to run a server with these features. Thanks Obama. I was going to host the server my PC, but as it turns out, it is against Optimum's terms of use (who even reads that?!?!).</p>
        <p>While I am faithful to the ideals of kylediaz.com, I am even more faithful to the US of A. Breaking the law is simply too illegal for me to handle. If you truely love America, freedom, hamburgers, babies, and relaxing walks, surely you would understand the predicament I are in</p>
        <p>While I can host <i>web servers</i> on my PC, the pros and cons of hosting a webster's dictionary on my PC are worse than the pros and cons of the kylediaz.com's current set up</p>
        <h1>"What does this mean for me?"</h1>
        <p>Literally nothing. The sorrow we feel today is not for what we lost, but what we are missing out on.</p>
        <p>Think of it like this: Elon Musk was walking down in front of 32°40’34.19″N 117° 9’27.58″W when a homeless man stopped him. The homeless woman asked "spare some change?". Bill Gates replied "EA? more like E-Gay". Everyone clapped and the Homeless person gave Bill Nye 100 Euros. The pope said <a href = "https://www.reddit.com/r/kylediaz/comments/8rp6vw/give_me_karma/">"give me karma"</a>. That homeless man's name? This is literally the worst thing I have ever written Im so sorry I should really stop using reddit.</p>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>While I know that your passion for kylediaz.com rivals religious zeal, Im sorry to say that there will be no new additions for kylediaz.com until summer vacation is over. Kyle Diaz and kylediaz.com are one and the same, and my face is the symbol of this holy site. Just like if a tree falls down in the woods and no one is around to hear it, there is no point in updating kylediaz.com when there is no one to see it.</p>
        <p>If you would like to reminisce on past memories of this website, you are always welcome to visit the <a href = "https://github.com/kylediaz/kylediaz.github.io">github page</a>.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for so many memories.</p>
        <p><br>Kyle Diaz</p>
